This release introduces a major new feature to combat a regression introduced in Switch firmware 19.0.0. For those unaware, Switch firmware 19.0.0 breaks compatibility with GCC adapters, including NaxGCC, which advertises itself as a GCC adapter.

Starting with this version, you will be able to connect NaxGCC in "Pro-Controller Mode" by pressing and holding `Start` while plugging it in. This will cause the NaxGCC to advertise itself as a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, and therefore be unaffected by the bug in the latest Switch firmware. All input consistency modes remain fully functional while in this mode, and your settings (including calibration) carry over as well.

While in Pro-Controller Mode, pressing `Z+Start` will act like the home button on a regular Pro Controller. Additionally, pressing `L` will press both `L` and `ZL` at the same time (since the GCC only has one left shoulder button). This is useful if you want to map things like jump (short-hop macro) or shield (prevent rolling) to it.

> [!NOTE]
> As of this version, rumble will _not_ work while in Pro Controller Mode.

To update your firmware, plug in your controller to your computer while keeping the `A+X+Y` buttons held. Then drag & drop the `.uf2` file (found below, under Downloads) onto the storage device that appears.
