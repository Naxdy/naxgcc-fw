This release introduces XInput mode for the NaxGCC. This mode is mostly useful for playing games on PC, as it offers the best out-of-the-box compatiblity experience with most titles. Similar to Pro-Controller Mode, this is not a permanent configuration that you set, but a mode that is activated by pressing a button while plugging your controller in.

To enter XInput Mode, press and hold the `X` button while plugging in your controller. While in XInput mode, your NaxGCC will _always_ poll at 1ms intervals, regardless of your chosen input consistency mode setting. Once you go back to GCC or Pro-Controller Mode, your desired input consistency setting will be restored.

> [!NOTE]
> As of this version, rumble will _not_ work while in XInput mode.

To update your firmware, plug in your controller to your computer while keeping the `A+X+Y` buttons held. Then drag & drop the `.uf2` file (found below, under Downloads) onto the storage device that appears.
