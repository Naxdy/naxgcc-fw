This marks the very first release of the NaxGCC firmware!

Compared to the PhobGCC firmware, the NaxGCC firmware has the following changes:

- fully rewritten in Rust, using the [embassy-rs](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy) framework for asynchronous operations
- directly connects to the console via USB, pretending to be a GCC adapter with 1 controller (itself) connected
- features a special "input consistency mode" that even further improves input consistency, beyond what is delivered by any other controller / adapter
- features an experimental "input latency mode" that reduces input latency even further, at a slight cost to input consistency compared to "consistency" mode
- improves button scan rate to ~50us (microseconds) compared to 1ms for the PhobGCC
- a few calibration button combos have changed (consult our documentation for details)
- pressing `A+X+Y` while plugging in the controller to your PC will enter bootloader mode, allowing you to flash a new firmware image

Huge thank you to the developers of the PhobGCC for providing a solid foundation to build upon!
