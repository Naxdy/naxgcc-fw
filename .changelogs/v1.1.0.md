This is mainly a QoL and performance update for the NaxGCC. The following changes have been made:

- Added a MSOS descriptor to the USB device, allowing the NaxGCC to be immediately recognized on Windows, without the need for a custom driver. This should make it plug-and-play for Dolphin on Windows.
- Improved the "rate limiting" of SuperHack mode, which should make it more consistent and less likely to drop inputs compared to "Consistency" mode.
- Added a new "PC" mode which polls at 1000Hz, for use on PC or other consoles that don't have any issues with 1000Hz polling. The "OG" mode now polls at 125Hz always, regardless of which device it is connected to.

To update your firmware, plug in your controller while keeping the `A+X+Y` buttons held. Then drag & drop the `.uf2` file (found below, under Downloads) onto the storage device that appears.
